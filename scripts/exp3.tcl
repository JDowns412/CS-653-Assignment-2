# This experiment is more controlled than the other too, but to introduce generalization we will:
#     1. Set up the network topology that is specified in the writeup
#     2. Start the TCP flow, as specified to do (first) in the writeup
#     3. Start the CBR flow, as specified to do (second) the writeup
#     ○   Although the writeup says we don’t need to vary the bandwidth of the CBR flow,
#         the directions don’t specify which capacity the CBR should be running at, so we
#         are still thinking of running the CBR at 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, and 99% of
#         the link’s total capacity. (please approve/disapprove of this, if feedback is being
#         given for this assignment)
#     4. Repeat this process for both queueing disciplines
